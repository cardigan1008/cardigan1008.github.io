## About Me

I am an undergraduate student of Software Engineering in Nanjing University. I am supervised by [Prof. Yang Feng](https://fengyang-nju.github.io/) at [SSCT-Lab](https://github.com/SSCT-Lab). My research interests lie in the Programming Language and Software Engineering. Recently, I have been working on the Rust Programming Language.

I regularly write about my research and thoughts on [my blog](/blog/). 

I'll be joining Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) as a Ph.D. student in 2025 Fall, under the supervision of [Prof. Shaohua Li](https://shao-hua-li.github.io/).
